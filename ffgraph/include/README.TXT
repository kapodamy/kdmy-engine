
Place here the FFmpeg header files, required folders are:

avcodec
avformat
avutil
swresample
swscale

If was necessary download the source code of FFmpeg to adquire the headers files, run "./configure" before copy.
thats because some headers like "avutil/avconfig.h" are generated by ffmpeg configure script. See https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide for more info.

(maybe important) the headers must match the target CPU arquitecture (in this case is x64).
