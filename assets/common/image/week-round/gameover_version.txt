README:
* this file indicates if "gameover.xml" is vainilla (not overrided).
* if the week overrides "gameover.xml" (changing the path to /assets/common/ folder) you SHOULD CHANGE THE FIRST LINE.
* the value "0" (zero) means the layout "gameover.xml" is not custom.
* the engine reads this file in before any week round (or track) gameplay.
* the engine ONLY reads the first character of this file, so not be creative.
* if the week uses different gameover screens on each track, the "gameover_version.txt" should be different.
* ¿how you override the "commons" folder?:
*	in "gameplay.json" file, property "customFolder".
*	via scripting, calling the function "fs_override_common_folder()".
* the "_version" honors the funkin behavior.
